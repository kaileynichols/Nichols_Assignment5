Introduction

Tidal wetlands are some of the most valuable coastal ecosystems globally as they offer a vast array of ecosystem services. Despite their significance, developmental pressures such as the influx of dyke infrastructure in Europe and North America have resulted in a 70% loss of historical salt marsh area. As a result, it is critical to develop a more thorough quantitative classification and description of ecological conditions of tidal wetlands to inform restoration projects as sea level rise poses impending threats to these globally significant ecosystems. This study aims to classify tidal wetland vegetation in NS and to determine the environmental influences associated with plant community composition in order to better understand the environmental factors and vegetation-environment relationships of tidal wetlands in Eastern Canada.
